Our algorithm uses two main functions. 
The “center” function is responsible for driving in the center. 
It is written using simple mathematical calculations. 
The second function “raspberry” is responsible for identifying objects standing in front of the robot.
To determine an object, the read function compares object with saved area and color. 
There is also a “dis” function for obtaining information from  sensors.
